- Virtually via Zoom [https://go.osu.edu/dataviz-zoom](https://go.osu.edu/dataviz-zoom)

## Course description
This course aims to introduce students to the principles and practice of data visualization. Students will learn fundamental principles of data visualization and create figures that appropriately and ethically represent their data. Data visualizations will be created in the R programming environment, using tools including the grammar of graphics implemented in ggplot2. In the process of creating visualizations, students will also become familiar with data handling and wrangling in R.

**Course learning outcomes**  
By the end of this course, students should successfully be able to:

- Recall and describe the fundamental goals and principles of data visualization.
- Distinguish between good and bad visualizations, and understand how to make those are ineffective more effective.
- Learn to use R, R Markdown, and ggplot to make clear, descriptive, and aesthetic visualization.
- Apply principles learned in class, both theoretical and technical, to create effective visualizations.

## Course delivery
**Mode of delivery:** This course is a hybrid-delivered course where I provide ~ 50 min of lecture material, followed by ~1 hour of recitation activities to do in-class (with assistance from the instructor and the TA). You can attend class in person or virtually via Zoom. You are also welcome to come to class with questions about the weekly videos, or problems you are currently encountering in creating your visualizations.

**Attendance and participation requirements:** This is a hybrid course, but is taught synchronously, meaning it is expected that you attend class, either in person or virtually (via Zoom) during its meeting time. I will not take attendance. If circumstances require you to miss class, it will be expected you watch the recorded sessions, and catch up on material on your own. I have found that students who attend classes more quickly and completely master course content.

**Class recordings:** To help you master material, and to better accommodate students, classes will be recorded, and recordings uploaded directly after class to Carmen. You can find a link to a OneDrive folder with the recorded lectures on the Syllabus page on Carmen.

- RStudio Desktop: This IDE (integrated development environment) allows a user-friendly interface with the R programming environment, which we will use in class as well.  You must have R before you download [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (free).
- Microsoft Office 365: All Ohio State students are now eligible for free Microsoft Office 365. Full instructions for downloading and installation can be found at [go.osu.edu/office365help](www.go.osu.edu/office365help).

## Prior R experience
You do not need to be an R expert for this class, but I will assume working-level knowledge of R programming.  If you have no experience with R, but would still like to take this class, you can. I ask then you get yourself up to speed by taking this free online class [https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics) (audit only) before the start of the 3rd week of class.  The course will take 8-16 hours to complete so please leave yourself enough time to do so before week 3. Tips and tricks in R will be scattered throughout the course material.

## Grading
### How your grade is calculated 

- Module assignments: 40 points (10 points per assignment, 4 assignments)
- Class reflections:	20 points (2 points per reflection, 10 reflections)
- Capstone assignment:	40 points

See the Assignments tab for additional information.

### Assignment descriptions

#### Module assignments

*Description*: After each module, there will be an assignment to provide practice for the techniques learned in class. Assignments will be posted at least one week prior to their due date, and due dates can be found on Carmen.

*Grading*: Each part of the assignment will have a certain number of points associated with it, provided along with the assignment.

*Academic Integrity*: Students may use class notes and class resource materials. Students are not permitted to collaborate on assignments. Students must complete work on their own.

#### Class reflections
After each week, you will write a 1 paragraph reflection on the material that was presented in class. This can include your thoughts on how you will use these lessons in your own research and data visualizations, ways in which you have investigated this topic (or expect to) on your own, or what else you’d like to learn in this area. The purpose of this assignment is not to be burdensome, but to keep you engaged in the course material, and providing feedback to me on what parts you’ve found useful, what you’ve struggled with, and what you’d like to see more of in the future.

There will be 10 class reflections (you can select which classes you want to reflect upon).

**Due Date:** Reflections are due 1 week after each class. For example, if class is on Tuesday September 1, the reflection for that class is due on Tuesday September 8 by 11:59pm.

*Grading*: Reflections will be graded as follows: 

- Full credit: Reflections thoughtfully engage with course content, demonstrate the student thought about material and how it would (or wouldn’t) be relevant to their work and development. This is the level of engagement I expect for this course.
- Half credit: Reflections are superficial and demonstrate minimal engagement with the course content. A half credit grade indicates better engagement is required for the next reflection. I do not expect to assign these grades often.

*Academic Integrity*: Students may use class notes and class resource materials. Students are not permitted to collaborate on assignments. Students must complete work on their own.

#### Capstone assignment

*Description*: At the end of the semester, you will complete a capstone assignment where you create a series of visualizations based on your research data, data coming from your lab, or other data that is publicly available. I expect this assignment to be completed in R Markdown, annotated, and knitted into an easy-to-read .html file. I also expect your code to be fully commented such that I can understand what you are doing with each step, and why. You will be required to submit a capstone assignment “plan” by the beginning of November.

*Grading*: Guidance will be provided for the grading of the capstone assignment. Assignments completed outside R Markdown, or not knitted to a .html are not acceptable.

*Academic Integrity*: Students may use class notes and class resource materials. Students are not permitted to collaborate on assignments. Students must complete work on their own.

#### Due dates

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
due_dates <- read_excel("../files/schedule_modules.xlsx",
                       sheet = "module_due_dates_2024")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 6}
kable(due_dates)
```


### Late assignments
I expect you will turn assignments in on time. Late assignments are not accepted. If there are extenuating circumstances that prevent you from turning in an assignment on time, please connect with me as soon as possible after such a situation arises for discussion about a possible deadline extension. 

Please refer to the Assignments tab or Carmen for due dates.

### Grading scale
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
grading_scale <- read_excel("../files/grading_scale.xlsx",
                       sheet = "Sheet1")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 4}
kable(grading_scale)
```

### Instructor feedback and response time
- Grading and feedback: For assignments, you can generally expect feedback within 7 days.
- Email: I will reply to emails within 48 hours on days when class is in session at the university.

## Other course policies

### Discussion and communication guidelines
I expect all communication will be respectful and thoughtful.

### Academic Misconduct/Academic Integrity 
Academic integrity is essential to maintaining an environment that fosters excellence in teaching, research, and other educational and scholarly activities. Thus, The Ohio State University and the Committee on Academic Misconduct (COAM) expect that all students have read and understand the University's Code of Student Conduct, and that all students will complete all academic and scholarly assignments with fairness and honesty. Students must recognize that failure to follow the rules and guidelines established in the University's Code of Student Conduct and this syllabus may constitute Academic Misconduct.

The Ohio State University's Code of Student Conduct (Section 3335-23-04) defines academic misconduct as: Any activity that tends to compromise the academic integrity of the University, or subvert the educational process. Examples of academic misconduct include (but are not limited to) plagiarism, collusion (unauthorized collaboration), copying the work of another student, and possession of unauthorized materials during an examination. Ignorance of the University's Code of Student Conduct is never considered an excuse for academic misconduct, so I recommend that you review the Code of Student Conduct and, specifically, the sections dealing with academic misconduct.

If I suspect that a student has committed academic misconduct in this course, I am obligated by University Rules to report my suspicions to the Committee on Academic Misconduct. If COAM determines that you have violated the University's Code of Student Conduct (i.e., committed academic misconduct), the sanctions for the misconduct could include a failing grade in this course and suspension or dismissal from the University.

**If you have any questions about the above policy or what constitutes academic misconduct in this course, please contact me.**
