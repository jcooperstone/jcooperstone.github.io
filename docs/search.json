There are a few ways to do this.\nLet’s practice handling strings by removing the comma. You can use str_remove() function from the tidyverse package stringr.

There are more tidyverse packages outside of these core eight, and we will talk about some of them another time.\n\ntl;dr Tidyverse has a lot of packages that make data analysis easier.

It’s not a really good plot, but its a plot and we can work from here.\nYou can see that what R has done is take each date, and plotted the total weight of tomatoes harvested on that day. What we can see from this part is that in the beginning of the season, there is little tomato production (this is not surprising to anyone who knows about horticulture or has grown tomatoes before), and production increases as the season progresses. We don’t see any harvest after mid-October which makes sense because Dr. Lendway lives in Minnesota and probably there was a frost that killed the plants (hence no more 🍅).\nA note about aesthetic mappings now that we have introduced geoms -aes() can go in two places:\n\nin the ggplot() call, and this means they will inherit for every layer of the plot\nin a specific geom_, and those aesthetics will only be for that specific geom.\n\nSo we can make the same plot we saw above by mapping aesthetics within geom_line().\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = weight))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s say we wanted to see how the harvest of different varieties looks over the summer?

We are seeing 12 lines instead of 1. This happens automatically under the hood. This ‘grouping’ will be maintained across additional geoms because it is in the global aesthetic mappings for the plot.\nWe can also add more than one geom. Let’s try adding geom_point() so we can better see exactly which times were sampled in this dataset.\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight, color = variety)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo more fully make the point about global vs aesthetic mappings, let’s look at an example.\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = variety)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can see that how the line layer is being grouped by variety, while the points are not. This is because the aesthetic mappings for one geom don’t inherit to the next one. If we want to also color points by variety, we need to either 1) set this as the global aesthetic mapping or 2) also set aes(color = variety) in geom_point() too.\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = variety)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = variety))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping vs. ‘setting’\nIf you want to map a variable to an aesthetic, it MUST be within the aes() statement. If you just want to change the color to “blue” for example, it should be outside the aes() statement. Look at the difference.\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook what happens if we put color = \"blue\" inside the aes() statement.\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight, color = \"blue\")) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntl:dr if mapping a variable to an aesthetic, inside aes(), if not, then outside.\n\n\n\nMore about aesthetics\nIt’s hard to talk about how to map to aesthetics before you add a geom, which is why this content is in this section.\nSo far we have talked about mapping aesthetics to x, y, and color. Below is a list of other aesthetics you can map to:\n\ncolor (or colour if that suits you better) and fill\nIn general color controls the outside/line, and fill controls the inside of a shape. Some geoms will work only with color or fill, and work with both. There are a millions ways to control the color, including by using the R color names (don’t forget to put them in quotes), or hex codes (e.g., “FF0000” for red). There are a ton of different color palettes in R like color brewer and I’d recommend you to think about using colors that are color blind friendly like viridis. Picking a color palette allows continuity across your presentation/manuscript, and can help in the interpretation of your data (e.g., having a divergent scale where darker means more abundant, or pairing colors like light and medium blue to indicate which samples have some kind of relationship).\n\n\nlinetype\nYou can change the style of a line based on a variable\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight)) +\n  geom_line(aes(linetype = variety))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow this is a disaster but you can see the point about mapping variables to linetype.\nHere are some different linetypes you can select from:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from ggplot documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize\nYou can also map variables to size. This could be useful if you wanted to say make your points bigger when a fold change is bigger, or bigger when a value is more significant. Below is an example of mapping weight to size in our example dataset.\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  filter(variety %in% c(\"Mortgage Lifter\", \"Brandywine\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = variety, y = date, size = weight)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshape\nYou can also map variables to shape. This could be useful if you want points of one treatment on a scatterplot to be circles, a second treatment triangles, etc. You can combine mapping to shape and color together which is good for those who are concerned about black and white printability, but also easy differentiability when viewed on a computer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from sthda\n\n\n\n\nShapes 0-20 accept only a color aesthetics. Shapes 21-25 accept both a color and fill aesthetic, where color controls the color of the outside of the shape, and fill controls the color of the inside of the shape. I basically always use shapes 21-25 (actually I almost always just use 21).\n\n\nalpha\nSetting alpha allows you to map a variable to the transparency of a part of your plot. So for example, if you had a correlation plot, you could make a strong correlation really dark, while a weak relationship lighter. Alpha can range between 0 and 1, where 0 is totally transparent, and 1 is completely opaque.\nThe next sections we will go over in more detail next week but I want to introduce the idea of these additional layers very briefly.",

    "section": "Facets",
    "text": "Facets\nFaceting allows to create small multiples of plots, enabling the easy comparison across the entirety of your data. A benefit of plots like this is they are all structured the same way, so once you understand one, you can begin to look at trends across groups/treatments/conditions simply and easily.\nHere is a more infographic example of using small multiples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Five Thirty Eight\n\n\n\n\nSo we can easily see that states with more of a maroon color have a lower than average life expectancy, while those that are higher than average are orange. We also can see easily where each state is on the map, so we can begin to understand how geography is related to life expectancy. We can also see which states have gotten better (i.e. their people live longer) with time, and those that haven’t. And this is all with a quick glance!\nIf we look back to the plot we were using as our example last week, can see how we have a plot faceted by tomato variety.\nFirst lets select only the data for tomatoes.\n\n# filter data to include only tomatoes \n# filter() is a useful function from dplyr (part of tidyverse)\n# it allows us to select observations based on their values\ngarden_harvest_tomato &lt;- garden_harvest |&gt;\n  filter(vegetable == \"tomatoes\")\n\nLet’s remember what our base plot is currently looking like.\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight, color = variety)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(size = 1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how crowded this is? I think faceting might help us better see our data by variety.\nThere are two functions that allow you to facet:\n\nfacet_wrap: allows to lay out your facets in a wrapped type. You can use facet_wrap if you have 1 variable you’d like to facet on.\nfacet_grid: allows you to lay out your facets in a grid. You can use facet_grid if you have 1 or 2 variables you’d like to facet on.\n\nThere are a few different sets of syntax that work for faceting, but I think this is the most intuitive.\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(variety))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will get a very reasonably different looking plot with facet_grid with the default settings.\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  facet_grid(vars(variety))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote because you have provided only one variable, ggplot has put that facet in one row.\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(variety))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make the faceting go by column, but this is also looks bad in this case\nHowever, you might be thinking now that if you have two variables, and you want to facet by the combination of them, you could do that with facet_grid. Here is an example with the mpg dataset from the tidyverse (since there isn’t really good data to demonstrate this from garden_harevst).\n\nmpg |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + # city and highway gas mileage\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(class), # category of car\n             rows = vars(drv)) # type of drive train, 4 wheel, front, rear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default in both facet_wrap and facet_grid are for the x and y-axis to be fixed and constant among all the plots. This is often what you want to take advance of the comparisons between small multiples, but this is something you can change if you want. You can adjust the scales within facets to:\n\nscales = \"fixed\": both the x- and y-axes are fixed for all plots to be the same (this is the default)\nscales = \"free\": both the x- and y-axes are set per plot\nscales = \"free_x\": the x-axis scales are free between plots\nscales = \"free_y\": the y-axis scales are free between plots\n\n\ngarden_harvest_tomato |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weight)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(variety), scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo note how this affects how easy it is to compare among the facets now. Also note that in this case, since we have all the same x-axis labels between the plots, when we set scales = \"free\" it really only changes the y, making it functionally equivalent to scales = \"free_y\". This will not hold true in other situations.",

In the last offering, I found that the process of wrangling data was by far the thing that people had the most trouble with. In recitations, and for module assignments, I would provide data in a way that would need some adjustment before visualization can be made - and if I’m being honest, I heard a lot of rumblings about this.\nStill, I am going to leave in the course activities that required data to the wrangled before visualization. I am doing this because real data is mostly not structured precisely how it needs to be to make the visualizations you want. I want to provide you all some practice to get comfortable with using your data lassos. This is something you need to get comfortable with on your coding journey.\nBut, I have added in this extra lecture to explicitly go over what I think are the most useful wrangling functions and tools you can use in R. I hope this introduces you to some of what is possible with R, so it will trigger your memory later when you need to use it. You can also always come back to this page during the course.",

You can certainly use R without using the tidyverse, but it has many packages that I think will make your life a lot easier. We will be using mostly tidyverse functions in this class, with some base R syntax scattered throughout.\nThe “core tidyverse” contains the 9 packages below:\n\ndplyr: for data manipulation\nggplot2: a “grammar of graphics” for creating beautiful plots\nreadr: for reading in rectangular data (i.e., Excel-style formatting)\ntibble: using tibbles as modern/better dataframes\nstringr: handling strings (i.e., text or stuff in quotes)\nforcats: for handling categorical variables (i.e., factors) (meow!)\ntidyr: to make “tidy data”\npurrr: for enhancing functional programming (also meow!)\nlubridate: for working with dates and times\n\nWe will be using many of these other packages in this course, but will talk about them as we go. There are more tidyverse packages outside of this core, and we will talk about some of them another time.\n\ntl;dr Tidyverse has a lot of packages that make data analysis easier. None of them are required, but I think you’ll find many tidyverse approaches easier and more intuitive than using base R.\n\nYou can find here some examples of comparing tidyverse and base R syntax.\nToday we will be mostly talking through functions that live within the dplyr package.",

The function read_csv() which is a part of the tidyverse package readr allows you to do this easily as it has a special function for this file type, as it is so common.\nMake sure that your file is within your working directory (or you have its relative or complete path), and you can install it (and save it) like this:\n\nsample_csv_data &lt;- read_csv(file = \"my-file-name.csv\")\n\n\n\n.xlsx\nThe second most common file type I import are those made in Excel.

We can use summarize() The syntax is new_column_name = function().\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  summarize(mean_price = mean(price))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  mean_price\n       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      3933.\n\n\nWe can also provide multiple items for summary.\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  summarize(mean_price = mean(price),\n            sd_price = sd(price),\n            count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  mean_price sd_price count\n       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1      3933.    3989. 53940\n\n\nHere are some examples of functions you can use within summarize():\n\nmean() and median(): calculate mean and median\nsd() and IQR(): calculate standard deviation and interquartile range\nmin() and max(): calculate min and max\nn() and n_distinct(): calculate how many observations there are, and how many distinct observations there are\n\nYou can also use the function across() combined with where() to calculate summary data “across” different columns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Allison Horst\n\n\n\n\nFor example, like we see in the illustration above, we might want to calculate the mean “across” all columns “where” if we asked if that column contains numeric data, we would get TRUE.\n\ndiamonds |&gt; \n  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  carat depth table price     x     y     z\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.798  61.7  57.5 3933.  5.73  5.73  3.54\n\n\nI hope you can start to see now how combining lots of these different functions together will help you achieve what you want with your coding.",

Typically, we use pivot_longer() to make an untidy dataset tidy.\npivot_wider() takes data that is embedded in the values of your dataframe, and puts this information in variable names. Or put differently, it spreads a variable across multiple columns. This makes your dataframe “wider”, i.e., increases the number of columns. Typically, pivot_wider() will make a dataset untidy.

    "text": "Handling strings\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Allison Horst\n\n\n\n\nHandling strings (i.e., “strings” of characters) could be multiple whole lessons, so my goal is to introduce you here to how to handle them. The tidyverse package to manage strings is called stringr. Sometimes you might want to automate extraction of only part of a value present in a column to use, remove some values, or split strings apart. This is valuable especially when the way that data is coded/recorded is different than the way you want it to be when you analyze it. Instead of manually recoding in excel, you can reproducibly and tracibly recode in R. You can read about all the functions within stringr here.\nYou can use regular expressions within stringr functions, but I’m not going to explicitly go over that (check out these code clubs regex1, regex2 if you want to learn more).\nI’m going to create some sample data to play with.\n\nstrings &lt;- tibble(\n  sample = c(rep.int(\"Treatment_Level1\", 3), \n             rep.int(\"Treatment_Level2\", 3),\n             rep.int(\"Treatment_Level3\", 3),\n             rep.int(\"Control_Level1\", 3),\n             rep.int(\"Control_Level2\", 3),\n             rep.int(\"Control_Level3\", 3)))\n\nLet’s look at it quickly.\n\nstrings\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 1\n   sample          \n   &lt;chr&gt;           \n 1 Treatment_Level1\n 2 Treatment_Level1\n 3 Treatment_Level1\n 4 Treatment_Level2\n 5 Treatment_Level2\n 6 Treatment_Level2\n 7 Treatment_Level3\n 8 Treatment_Level3\n 9 Treatment_Level3\n10 Control_Level1  \n11 Control_Level1  \n12 Control_Level1  \n13 Control_Level2  \n14 Control_Level2  \n15 Control_Level2  \n16 Control_Level3  \n17 Control_Level3  \n18 Control_Level3  \n\n\nLet’s first ask how many times do we have the string “3” in our dataframe? Note that these functions accept a vector, so you need to provide data in that form. The function str_detect() gives a logical vector as the output, the same length as the vector provided, and indicates FALSE when the pattern is not met, and TRUE when it is.\n\nstr_detect(strings$sample, pattern = \"3\")\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[13] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n# using sum will count how many times the logical is evaluated to be TRUE\nsum(str_detect(strings$sample, pattern = \"3\"))\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nYou might want to re-code your data so that Level1 becomes that actual level used. Let’s say that Level1 is 100mg, Level2 is 300 mg, and Level3 is 500mg. We can do this with str_replace() to replace the first match only or str_replace_all() to replace all matches (which is what we want here).\n\n(strings$sample &lt;- strings |&gt; \n  select(sample) |&gt; \n  pull(sample) |&gt; # make a vector so can pass to next fxn\n  str_replace_all(pattern = \"Level1\", replacement = \"100mg\") |&gt; \n  str_replace_all(pattern = \"Level2\", replacement = \"300mg\") |&gt; \n  str_replace_all(pattern = \"Level3\", replacement = \"500mg\"))   \n\n [1] \"Treatment_100mg\" \"Treatment_100mg\" \"Treatment_100mg\" \"Treatment_300mg\"\n [5] \"Treatment_300mg\" \"Treatment_300mg\" \"Treatment_500mg\" \"Treatment_500mg\"\n [9] \"Treatment_500mg\" \"Control_100mg\"   \"Control_100mg\"   \"Control_100mg\"  \n[13] \"Control_300mg\"   \"Control_300mg\"   \"Control_300mg\"   \"Control_500mg\"  \n[17] \"Control_500mg\"   \"Control_500mg\"  \n\n\nWe might not want to have both Treatment/Control and Level nested in the same cell, we can split them apart using separate_*() functions. Here we are using separate_wider_delim() to seprate the column “sample” into two new columns called “treatment” and “dose.\n\n(strings_separated &lt;- strings |&gt; \n  separate_wider_delim(cols = sample,\n                       delim = \"_\", # what is the delimiter\n                       names = c(\"treatment\", \"dose\")))\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 2\n   treatment dose \n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 Treatment 100mg\n 2 Treatment 100mg\n 3 Treatment 100mg\n 4 Treatment 300mg\n 5 Treatment 300mg\n 6 Treatment 300mg\n 7 Treatment 500mg\n 8 Treatment 500mg\n 9 Treatment 500mg\n10 Control   100mg\n11 Control   100mg\n12 Control   100mg\n13 Control   300mg\n14 Control   300mg\n15 Control   300mg\n16 Control   500mg\n17 Control   500mg\n18 Control   500mg\n\n\nThe opposite function for separate_() is unite().\nIf we wanted to extract just the number part out of “dose” we could use readr::parse_number() to do that. Note I’ve embedded parse_number() within a mutate() function to change the values in the dataset.\n\nstrings_separated |&gt; \n  mutate(dose = parse_number(dose))\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 2\n   treatment  dose\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Treatment   100\n 2 Treatment   100\n 3 Treatment   100\n 4 Treatment   300\n 5 Treatment   300\n 6 Treatment   300\n 7 Treatment   500\n 8 Treatment   500\n 9 Treatment   500\n10 Control     100\n11 Control     100\n12 Control     100\n13 Control     300\n14 Control     300\n15 Control     300\n16 Control     500\n17 Control     500\n18 Control     500",

    "text": "Scatterplots\nA very simple first pass way to understand if you have relationships within your data is to make scatterplots of the variables you think might be correlated. Let’s start by investigating how the different alkaloid concentrations are correlated to each other. First we will see how alpha-tomatine content (Tomatine) is related to total steroidal alkaloid content (Total).\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Total, y = Tomatine)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Total Steroidal Alkaloids (µg/100 g)\",\n       y = \"Alpha-Tomatine (µg/100 g)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like there are two separate groups here - the points with a steeper slope, and the points with a less steep slope. We can color our points based on what Class of tomato the data comes from, maybe that will reveal something. In the meanwhile let’s make this plot look a bit nicer. The package scales has some nice functions that help you control the scaling of your plots, in this case, making each of the axes have numbers in comma_format(). I also am using the hex codes for a color-blind friendly qualitative color scheme developed by Paul Tol.\n\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    discard\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Total, y = Tomatine, color = Class)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels =) + # requires the package scales\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(big.mark = \",\")) + # requires the package scales\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#4477AA\", \"#EE6677\", \"#228833\", \"#CCBB44\", \"#66CCEE\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Total Steroidal Alkaloids (µg/100 g fresh weight)\",\n       y = \"Alpha-Tomatine (µg/100 g fresh weight)\",\n       title = \"Relationship between Alpha-Tomatine and Total Steroidal Alkaloids \\nAcross Different Germplasm in the Red Tomato Clade\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the tomatoes in the two extremes of this plot are from the Class Wild Cherry. What would this look like if we removed these fruits? Note, I adjusted the color scale to remove the hex code associated with Wild Cherry but keeping the other colors the same.\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  filter(Class != \"Wild Cherry\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Total, y = Tomatine, color = Class)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma_format(big.mark = \",\")) + # requires the package scales\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(big.mark = \",\")) + # requires the package scales\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#4477AA\", \"#EE6677\", \"#228833\", \"#CCBB44\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Total Steroidal Alkaloids (µg/100 g fresh weight)\",\n       y = \"Alpha-Tomatine (µg/100 g fresh weight)\",\n       title = \"Relationship between Alpha-Tomatine and Total Steroidal Alkaloids \\nAcross Different Germplasm in the Red Tomato Clade\")",

    "text": "Geoms for distributions\n\ngeom_col()\nOften, people use bar charts, representing the height or the length of the bar as proportional to the average value that it represents. These charts are sometimes called dynamite plots because they resemble (when they have an error bar with whisker) those cartoon style dynamite sticks. Pow!\nHowever, these bar charts, even if you add a standard deviation/error, really can hide the true distribution of your data, and for this reason, I and others hope you don’t select to make them.\nAside: You may be thinking “Jess you asked us to make one of these in Module 2 homework” and I did but also that was a little different. The plot I asked you to make shows the number of degrees awarded, a value for which there really is no distribution. So in that case we are using a bar plot to show something different than a bar plot which is meant to show somehow an average/median and distribution.\nI hope after today, you see that there is always a better chart type to make than a bar chart. But I will show you how to make them anyway.\nBefore we plot, let’s calculate some summary statistics so we know what we should expect.\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  group_by(Class) |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_tomatine = mean(Tomatine))\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Class                 mean_tomatine\n  &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Cultivated Cherry              235.\n2 Cultivated Processing          330.\n3 S. pimpinellifolium            685.\n4 Wide Cross Hybrid              534.\n5 Wild Cherry                   4928.\n\n\n\n# this is wrong but an easy mistake to make\n# this is not what we want\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Tomatine)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust calling geom_col() does not give us what we want. Look at the y-axis scale and how out of line this is with our summary statistics. The reason for this is that geom_col() defaults to position = \"stack\" which will just sum the alkaloid content across all the observations. Even changing to position = \"identity\" does not work. This is because we are plotting a transformation of the data (calculation of the mean) which these geoms are not doing.\nWe can calculate manually by generating the summary values and then piping that into our ggplot call.\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  group_by(Class) |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_tomatine = mean(Tomatine)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = mean_tomatine)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstat_summary()\nAn easier way to do this would be just with stat_summary(), which does not require the calculation of summary statistic first.\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Tomatine)) +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"bar\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReordering x-variables\nNote in these plots the ordering of the x-axis categories – they are alphabetical. This is the ggplot default. There are many reasons why this might not be the most compelling ordering for your data. You may want to order from lowest to highest mean, or in this case, I want to order the tomatoes from most cultivated on the left, to most wild on the right, since this is the prevailing theme of our paper.\nWe can do this in two ways:\nSimply reorder the plot.\n\n# set what the order is\nalkaloids_order &lt;- c(\"Cultivated Processing\",\n                     \"Cultivated Cherry\",\n                     \"Wide Cross Hybrid\",\n                     \"Wild Cherry\",\n                     \"S. pimpinellifolium\")\n\n# plot and re-level within aes()\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Class, levels = alkaloids_order), y = Tomatine)) +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"bar\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the levels of the data so the reordering happens to every plot in the future.\n\n# what type of variable is Class?\nclass(alkaloids$Class)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n# convert to factor, and set levels\nalkaloids$Class &lt;- factor(alkaloids$Class,\n                          levels = c(\"Cultivated Processing\",\n                                     \"Cultivated Cherry\",\n                                     \"Wide Cross Hybrid\",\n                                     \"Wild Cherry\",\n                                     \"S. pimpinellifolium\"))\n\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Tomatine)) +\n  stat_summary(fun = \"mean\", geom = \"bar\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy tendency would be to re-level the data if I always want to use the same order, and just re-level the plot if I only want to do this once or twice.\nYou can also re-order factors based on characteristics of your data using different functions that are part of the forcats package.\n\n\n\ngeom_boxplot()\nA boxplot has the benefit of showing you more than the median and the standard deviation, so you can better see the true distribution of your data. With geom_boxplot():\n\nLower whisker: smallest observation greater than or equal to lower hinge - 1.5 * IQR\nLower hinge/bottom line of box part of boxplot 25% quantile\nMiddle: median, 50% quantile\nUpper hinge/top line of box part of boxplot 75% quantile\nUpper whisker largest observation less than or equal to upper hinge + 1.5 * IQR\n\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Tomatine)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason why this is really importantly different from the bar plot is look at the number of outliers we are seeing for Wild Cherry. You don’t capture this at all with the median/mean bar plots.\nBecause of the scale of this data, it might be beneficial to log transform the y-axis.\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Tomatine)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\") # or scale_y_log10()\n\nWarning in scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\"): log-10 transformation\nintroduced infinite values.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 3 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_jitter()\ngeom_jitter() is a shortcut for geom_point(position = \"jitter\"), but is common enough that the shortcut exists. It is often nice to jitter on top of a boxplot. Note, if you don’t want the outliers from geom_boxplot() to be plotted twice, you should indicate outlier.shape = NA.\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Tomatine)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\") # or scale_y_log10()\n\nWarning in scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\"): log-10 transformation introduced infinite values.\nlog-10 transformation introduced infinite values.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 3 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJittering introduces a small amount of variation into your points so they’re easier to see.\n\nA width of 0 is no horizontal jitter\nA height of 0 is no vertical jitter\n\nTypically you don’t want veritcal jitter so that the points retain their fidelity on the y-axis (which is where their concentration is plotted). I basically always use geom_jitter(height = 0) for plots where I want to retain y-axis fidelity.\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Tomatine)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +\n  geom_jitter(height = 0) +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\") # or scale_y_log10()\n\nWarning in scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\"): log-10 transformation introduced infinite values.\nlog-10 transformation introduced infinite values.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 3 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_histogram()\nWe could also look at these distribution more like histograms and it provides to us some additional information. When coupled with faceting, this can be very powerful.\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Tomatine)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 75) + # default is bins = 30\n  scale_x_continuous(trans = \"log10\") +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Class))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Tomatine)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans = \"log10\") +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Class))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggridges::geom_density_ridges()\nI really like the function geom_density_ridges() which is a part of the ggplot add-on package ggridges. It allows you to create ridgeline plots to show distributes in a single non-faceted plot.\n\nlibrary(ggridges) # for ridgeline plots\nlibrary(scales) # for comma format\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  filter(Tomatine != 0) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Tomatine, y = Class)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans = \"log10\", labels = comma) +\n  labs(x = \"Alpha-tomatine content, µg/100g fresh weight\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Distribution of Alpha-Tomatine Content Across 107 Accessions \\nof Tomato Grown Across 3 Environments\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use the function geom_density_ridges() which will allow you to easily map quantiles or other functions on top of your ridges.\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  filter(Tomatine != 0) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Tomatine, y = Class)) +\n  stat_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5,\n                      quantile_lines = TRUE,\n                      quantiles = 2) + # break into 2 groups, therefore median\n  scale_x_continuous(trans = \"log10\", labels = comma) +\n  labs(x = \"Alpha-tomatine content, µg/100g fresh weight\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Distribution of Alpha-Tomatine Content Across 107 Accessions \\nof Tomato Grown Across 3 Environments\",\n       caption = \"Black line represents tomato class median concent\")\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 0.198\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging class labels\nI am bothered by the fact that S. pimpinellifolium (a species of wild tomato) is not indicated in italics. We don’t want to italicize all of the labels, just S. pimpinellifolium. Let’s fix that.\nWe can start by creating a vector of the labels how we want them to appear in the plot.\n\nclass_labels &lt;- c(\"Cultivated Processing\", \n                  \"Cultivated Cherry\",\n                  \"Wide Cross Hybrid\", \n                  \"Wild Cherry\",\n                  expression(italic(\"S. pimpinellifolium\")))\n\nclass_labels\n\nexpression(\"Cultivated Processing\", \"Cultivated Cherry\", \"Wide Cross Hybrid\", \n    \"Wild Cherry\", italic(\"S. pimpinellifolium\"))\n\n\nThen we can use one of the scale_*() functions to change our y-axis scale labels to how we want them to be.\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  filter(Tomatine != 0) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Tomatine, y = Class)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans = \"log10\", labels = comma) +\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = class_labels) +\n  labs(x = \"Alpha-tomatine content, µg/100g fresh weight\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Distribution of Alpha-Tomatine Content Across 107 Accessions \\nof Tomato Grown Across 3 Environments\")\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 0.198\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf for example your variables were mapped to color or fill, you could do this using scale_color_manual() or scale_fill_manual(), respectively.\n\n\n\nggdist functions\nAnother ggplot extension package ggdist has cool geoms you can integrate into ggplots to visualize distributions. I think these work better than geom_dotplot().\nSometimes using geom_jitter() when you have a lot of data points can look a bit messy. I think in this case, using geom_dots() works very well. The default orientation is is layout = \"bin\"\n\nlibrary(ggdist)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'ggdist'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:ggridges':\n\n    scale_point_color_continuous, scale_point_color_discrete,\n    scale_point_colour_continuous, scale_point_colour_discrete,\n    scale_point_fill_continuous, scale_point_fill_discrete,\n    scale_point_size_continuous\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  filter(Tomatine != 0) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Tomatine, y = Class)) +  \n  geom_dots() +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans = \"log10\", labels = comma) + \n  scale_y_discrete(labels = class_labels) +\n  labs(x = \"Alpha-tomatine, µg/100 g fresh weight\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Distribution of alkaloid content found among \\ntomatoes of different classes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can really change the feel of the plot by changing the orientation between horizontal and vertical. If you want to use the orientation layout = \"swarm\" you need the package ggbeeswarm. This is also a nice package that performs similarly to ggdist but has less functionality which is why I’m covering ggdist here.\n\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm) # required for layout = \"swarm\"\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  filter(Tomatine != 0) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Tomatine)) +\n  geom_dots(side = \"both\", layout = \"swarm\") + # requires ggbeeswarm\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = class_labels) +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\", labels = comma) + \n  labs(x = \"\",\n       y = \"Alpha-tomatine, µg/100 g fresh weight\",\n       title = \"Distribution of alkaloid content found among tomatoes of different classes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use stat_dotsinterval() which will by default add the median and the interquartile range (though you can change exactly what you want to be displayed).\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  filter(Tomatine != 0) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Tomatine)) +\n  stat_dotsinterval(side = \"both\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = class_labels) +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\", labels = comma) + \n  labs(x = \"\",\n       y = \"Alpha-tomatine, µg/100 g fresh weight\",\n       title = \"Distribution of alkaloid content found among tomatoes of different classes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t forget we can keep layering. We can always map other aethetics to our plot (e.g. shape = as.factor(Year), and we include as.factor() because Year is a character datatype).\n\nalkaloids |&gt;\n  filter(Tomatine != 0) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Tomatine, shape = as.factor(Year))) +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\", labels = comma) + \n  geom_dots(side = \"both\") +\n  theme_ggdist() +\n  theme(legend.position = c(.18, .99),\n        legend.justification = c(\"right\", \"top\"),\n        legend.box.just = \"right\",\n        legend.box.background = element_rect(color = \"black\"),\n        legend.box.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5)) +\n  labs(shape = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Alpha-tomatine (µg/100 g fresh weight)\")",

You can indicate which sheet you want to import in the arguments to read_excel().\n\nalkaloid_blups &lt;- read_excel(\"data/tpg220192-sup-0002-supmat.xlsx\",\n                             sheet = \"S3 BLUP Diversity Panel\")\n\nLet’s take a look at this new data sheet.\n\nknitr::kable(head(alkaloid_blups))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenotype\nPlot_Source\nSpecies\nClass\nOrigin\nProvence\nBlanca_Cluster1\nBlanca_Cluster2\nPassport_Species\nPassport_Classification\nSim_Grouping\nDehydrotomatidine\nTomatidine\nDehydrotomatineA1\nDehydrotomatine2\nTotalDehydrotomatine\nTomatine\nHydroxytomatine1\nHydroxytomatine2\nHydroxytomatine3\nHydroxytomatine4\nTotalHydroxytomatine\nAcetoxytomatine1\nAcetoxytomatine2\nAcetoxytomatine3\nTotalAcetoxytomatine\nDehydrolycoperosideFGdehydroesculeosideA\nLycoperosideFGEsculeosideA1\nLycoperosideFGEsculeosideA2\nTotalLycoperosideFGEsculeosideA\nEsculeosideB1\nEsculeosideB2\nEsculeosideB3\nTotalEsculeosideB\nTotal\nLatitude\nLongitude\n\n\n\n\nCULBPT_05_11\n2K9-8584\nProcessing\nCultivated Processing\nUSA\nNY\nSLL_processing_2\nSLL_processing_2\nSLL\nSLL_processing_NY\nArid\n0.0001504\n0.0043495\n0.0072241\n-0.0010738\n0.0061503\n0.1929106\n0.0102521\n0.1596566\n0.0352666\n0.0864042\n0.2917962\n-0.0680508\n-0.1242448\n0.0117481\n-0.1805475\n-0.0369856\n0.0056573\n-0.1693034\n-0.1636462\n-0.0340685\n-0.0061713\n-0.0371543\n-0.0773942\n0.0365648\n40.712800000000001\n-74.006\n\n\nCULBPT_05_15\n2K9-8622\nProcessing\nCultivated Processing\nUSA\nNY\nSLL_processing_2\nSLL_processing_2\nSLL\nSLL_processing_NY\nArid\n-0.0000272\n-0.0001716\n0.0086547\n0.0000000\n0.0086547\n0.2824926\n0.0006910\n0.1118818\n0.0243950\n0.0189345\n0.1559021\n0.0038232\n0.0467380\n0.0024737\n0.0530349\n0.0066251\n0.0125334\n0.3417664\n0.3542998\n0.0138429\n0.0021833\n0.0139309\n0.0299571\n0.8907677\n40.712800000000001\n-74.006\n\n\nCULBPT_05_22\n2K17-7708-1\nProcessing\nCultivated Processing\nUSA\nNY\nSLL_processing_2\nSLL_processing_2\nSLL\nSLL_processing_NY\nArid\n-0.0000649\n-0.0002516\n0.0085205\n0.0000000\n0.0085205\n0.1755250\n-0.0001804\n0.0505547\n0.0040900\n0.0023229\n0.0576202\n0.0078240\n0.0069610\n-0.0001145\n0.0146705\n0.0031468\n0.0150674\n0.3840689\n0.3991363\n0.0007128\n0.0008227\n0.0028133\n0.0043489\n0.6618186\n40.712800000000001\n-74.006\n\n\nCULBPT04_1\n2K9-8566\nProcessing\nCultivated Processing\nUSA\nNY\nSLL_processing_2\nSLL_processing_2\nSLL\nSLL_processing_NY\nArid\n-0.0000272\n0.0001259\n-0.0038737\n0.0000000\n-0.0038737\n-0.0061446\n0.0015930\n0.1059454\n0.0195829\n0.0083566\n0.1354779\n0.0098585\n0.0095344\n0.0007941\n0.0201870\n0.0049377\n0.0100416\n0.3466282\n0.3566699\n0.0100830\n0.0006432\n0.0089015\n0.0196277\n0.5269806\n40.712800000000001\n-74.006\n\n\nE6203\n2K9-8600\nProcessing\nCultivated Processing\nUSA\nCA\nSLL_processing_1\nSLL_processing_1_1\nSLL\nSLL_processing_CA\nArid\n-0.0000272\n0.0000159\n0.0099538\n0.0000000\n0.0099538\n0.2929606\n0.0000000\n0.0227075\n0.0039160\n0.0088279\n0.0354514\n0.0002365\n0.0395374\n0.0041794\n0.0439532\n0.0027439\n0.0133225\n0.3018732\n0.3151958\n0.0080894\n-0.0003574\n0.0100045\n0.0177365\n0.7179839\n36.778300000000002\n-119.4179\n\n\nF06-2041\n2K16-9843\nProcessing\nCultivated Processing\nUSA\nOH\nSLL_processing_1\nSLL_processing_1_3\nSLL\nSLL_processing_OH\nHumid\n-0.0000272\n-0.0001648\n-0.0011236\n0.0000000\n-0.0011236\n0.0169681\n0.0011237\n0.0195573\n-0.0016308\n-0.0016069\n0.0188454\n-0.0004237\n0.0271524\n-0.0005286\n0.0262002\n0.0053084\n0.0049033\n0.1647694\n0.1696728\n-0.0006298\n-0.0003074\n0.0019315\n0.0009943\n0.2352713\n40.417299999999997\n-82.9071\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the dimensions of this dataframe?\n\ndim(alkaloid_blups)\n\n[1] 107  37\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we have the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) representing the alkaloid content of 107 genotypes of tomatoes.

Here, each point represents a sample, and we are plotting their coordinates typically for the first 2 PCs. Sometimes people make 3D PCA plots with the first 3 PCs but I think these are not easy to look in 2D and I wouldn’t recommend you to put them in your papers.\n\nUsing fviz_pca_ind()\nWe can also look at a scores plot using fviz_pca_ind() where ind means individuals. Here, each point is a sample.\n\nfviz_pca_ind(alkaloids_pca)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause our alkaloids_pca doesn’t have any meta-data, this is a hard to interpret plot, where each number indicates the rownumber of that sample. Making the scores plot this way is useful because it shows us the shape of the plot which we can use to confirm that we have made a ggplot that looks like its been created correctly.\n\n\nManually\nWe want to plot the scores, which are in provided in alkaloids_pca$x.\nWe can convert the list into a dataframe of scores values by using as.data.frame().

The x-axis shows the position on each chromosome, and the y-axis shows the negative log (usually log10) p-value of the quantitative response of a trait to that specific marker. Negative log10 p-value is used because a significant p-value is always small, and this transformation converts low p-value to a number that can be seen easily among the background of non-significant associations.\nIf you work in genetics/genomics, it is likely you will create Manhattan plots.

This data is more complex than a typical GWAS so we are only going to use a small portion of it.\nWe will be reading in Table S16 which includes the -log10 p-values for the GWAS conducted across all apples for all features found in the LC-MS negative ionization mode metabolomics dataset.\nThe data is present in a .csv file, so we will use the function read_csv() from the tidyverse.

    "text": "Manhattan plot: chlorogenic acid\nAt its core, a Manhattan plot is a scatter plot. The data we are working with has 4701 traits, which here are relative metabolite abundance. We are going to pick one metabolite to start working with.\nWe will start with the feature that represents chlorogenic acid, a caffeoyl-quinic acid you find in apples. The column we want is X353.09194_2.23795. The data is already present as the -log10 p-value for the relationship between allelic variation at that marker, and relative abundance of chlorogenic acid.\n\n# rename X353.09194_2.23795 to chlorogenic_acid\ngwas &lt;- gwas %&gt;%\n  rename(chlorogenic_acid = `X353.09194_2.23795`)\n\ngwas %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Index, y = chlorogenic_acid, color = Linkage_Group)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how color is plotted on a continuous scale? This is because Linkage_Group is a continuous, numeric variable. Since each chromosome is actually discrete, let’s convert Linkage_Group to a factor and then plot again.\n\nLinkage_Group as a factor\n\n# make Linkage_Group a factor\ngwas$Linkage_Group &lt;- as.factor(gwas$Linkage_Group)\n\n# first pass manhattan plot\ngwas %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Index, y = chlorogenic_acid, color = Linkage_Group)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter but this really isn’t what we want.

We can use the conservative Bonferroni correction, which takes our p-value, and the total number of comparisons we are making, creating a new adjusted value that our p-values need to be less than to be considered significant.

Here, feature_of_interest is just the name I’ve assigned here, but you could easily call it x or i or whatever.\n\n# write a function to make your plots across the features of interest\nmanhattan_plot &lt;- function(feature_of_interest){\n  gwas_top50_long %&gt;% # our df with only the top 50, but long\n  filter(feature == feature_of_interest) %&gt;% # pick the feature_of_interest only\n  ggplot(aes(x = Index, y = neg_log10_p, color = Linkage_Group)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = bonferroni_pval, color = \"grey\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0),\n                     breaks = (set_axis$center + set_axis$min), \n                     labels = set_axis$Linkage_Group) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = rep(c(\"black\", \"gray\"),17)) +\n  labs(x = \"Chromosome\",\n       y = expression(\"-log\"[10]*\"P-Value\"),\n       title = glue(\"{feature_of_interest}\")) + # here we glue the feature name in the title\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n  }\n\nBefore trying to use our new function manhattan_plot on 50 features, let’s try it out on one. We can provide our feature of interest as a string.\n\nmanhattan_plot(\"X599.12186_2.10421\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that our function is working for one feature, let’s create a vector of features to iterate over, and plot. I am calling that vector features_to_plot. It contains the unique feature names from gwas_top50_long.\n\nfeatures_to_plot &lt;- unique(gwas_top50_long$feature)\n\n\n\nApplying the function with map().\nOnce we have our function written, we can apply that function over a vector using purrr:map(). What map() does is take a function and apply it to a vector. In this case, the function is manhattan_plot (the function that makes a Manhattan plot), and it is applied over features_to_plot, the vector of features we want a plot for.\n\n# create an object called my_plots which is a list \n# the list contains our 50 plots\nmy_plots &lt;- map(features_to_plot, # vector to apply over\n            manhattan_plot) # what function to use\n\n# print the first 6\nmy_plots[1:6]\n\n[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[3]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[4]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[5]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[6]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving out plots\nBut you can print them all, save particular ones using ggsave(), or do what we are going to do here, which is save each of them to a new folder, each as their own .svg because why use raster when you can vectorize.\nFirst we will create a vector of what we want our file names to look like, and apply them to be the names of our plots.\n\n# use str_c to combine two character vectors\n# here, features_to_plot and adding .svg so the file name \n# includes the extension type\n# then set that as the names for my_plots\nnames(my_plots) &lt;- str_c(features_to_plot, \".svg\")\n\nThen, we will save.\n\n# use pwalk to \"walk\" across the different plots and save them\n# to use the path subfolder \"img\" you need to create that in your working dir\npwalk(list(names(my_plots), my_plots), # what to iterate over and output\n      ggsave, # what the function is\n      path = \"img/\") # where they should go\n\nNow all of your plots are in your working directory. Remember, you need to add the directory img if you want to save with the code I’m using here.",

Hint, to do this you’ll probably have to do some data wrangling first.\nFirst I will calculate the total number of Ph.D.s awarded across each broad_field for the whole time period.\n\nbroad_field_sum &lt;- phd_field |&gt;\n  group_by(broad_field) |&gt;\n  summarize(broad_field_sum = sum(n_phds, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  arrange(-broad_field_sum)\n\nbroad_field_sum\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  broad_field                       broad_field_sum\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Life sciences                              205703\n2 Psychology and social sciences             119116\n3 Humanities and arts                         53045\n4 Education                                   52639\n5 Mathematics and computer sciences           35481\n6 Other                                       28855\n7 Engineering                                 18139\n\n\nThis summary helps me know what to expect to see in my plots. Now I can create some plots.\nThe first one will just show the total number of Ph.D.s across each broad_field. I decided to put the broad_field on the y-axis so that the labels are easier to read. I’ve also re-ordered broad_field based on the total number of PhDs for each category (i.e., broad_field_sum). I chose to use no colors because I didn’t feel like it was adding much here.\n\nbroad_field_sum |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = broad_field_sum, y = fct_reorder(broad_field, broad_field_sum))) +\n  geom_col(color = \"black\", fill = \"grey\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma) + # add a comma to the x-axis breaks\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Total number of Ph.D.s\",\n       y = \"\", # no label on the y\n       title = \"Number of PhDs awarded across different \\nbroad disciplines from 2008-2017\",\n       caption = \"Data collected by the National Science Foundation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following few examples weren’t exactly the question (which was to show total PhDs across each broad_field across the total time period of this data), but I’ll show you here how to make some other stuff.\n\nbroad_field_sumonly_eachyear &lt;- phd_field |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  summarize(all_the_phds = sum(n_phds, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\nbroad_field_sumonly_eachyear\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n    year all_the_phds\n   &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  2008        48026\n 2  2009        49141\n 3  2010        47628\n 4  2011        48546\n 5  2012        50777\n 6  2013        52370\n 7  2014        53364\n 8  2015        54154\n 9  2016        54862\n10  2017        54110\n\n\nThen we can plot.\n\nbroad_field_sumonly_eachyear |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = all_the_phds)) +\n  geom_col(color = \"black\", fill = \"grey\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + # add a comma to the x-axis breaks\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2008, 2017, 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Ph.Ds\", \n       title = \"Total number of Ph.D.s awarded in the United States per year from 2008-2017\",\n       caption = \"Data collected by the National Science Foundation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis wasn’t exactly the question, but if we want to see a little bit better this over the time period, first we need to create a df that has total PhDs per broad field per year. We can do this by adding year to our group_by() statement.\n\nbroad_field_sum_byyear &lt;- phd_field |&gt;\n  group_by(broad_field, year) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_phds = sum(n_phds, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'broad_field'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n# what does that look like\nhead(broad_field_sum_byyear)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   broad_field [1]\n  broad_field  year total_phds\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Education    2008       6561\n2 Education    2009       6528\n3 Education    2010       5287\n4 Education    2011       4670\n5 Education    2012       4803\n6 Education    2013       4934\n\n\nNow we can plot. We can now make different types of plots. Let’s start simpler. Here I’ve re-ordered the legend to be in the same order as the chart so you can see the disciplines that award the most Ph.D.s just by looking at the order of the legend.\n\nbroad_field_sum_byyear |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = total_phds, \n    # reorder broad_field by descending total_phds         \n             color = reorder(broad_field, -total_phds))) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2008, 2017, 2)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total number of Ph.D.s\",\n       color = \"Broad Field\",\n       title = \"Number of Ph.D.s awarded by discipline in the United States\",\n       subtitle = \"From 2008-2017\",\n       caption = \"Data collected by the National Science Foundation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould also try facets.\n\n# re-setting factors of broad_field so that it is re-levelled by the discipline with\n# the most phds\n# you could also do this manually\nbroad_field_sum_byyear$broad_field &lt;- fct_reorder(broad_field_sum_byyear$broad_field,\n                                                  -broad_field_sum_byyear$total_phds)\n\nbroad_field_sum_byyear |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = total_phds, color = broad_field)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2008, 2017, 2)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(broad_field)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total number of Ph.D.s\",\n       color = \"Broad Field\",\n       title = \"Number of Ph.D.s awarded by discipline in the United States\",\n       subtitle = \"From 2008-2017\",\n       caption = \"Data collected by the National Science Foundation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan also try with “free_y” axes.

I will not take attendance. If circumstances require you to miss class, it will be expected you watch the recorded sessions, and catch up on material on your own.

Assignments will be posted at least one week prior to their due date, and due dates can be found on Carmen.\nGrading: Each part of the assignment will have a certain number of points associated with it, provided along with the assignment.\nAcademic Integrity: Students may use class notes and class resource materials. Students are not permitted to collaborate on assignments. Students must complete work on their own.\n\n\nRecitation submissions\nDescription: I ask you submit 8 of 11 recitations to Carmen to show you have made a good faith effort to engage with the course material.\nGrading: I will mark these at 0 or 1 points, with 1 point given for completion of at least 70% of the assignment.\nAcademic Integrity: Students may use class notes and class resource materials. Students are not permitted to collaborate on assignments. Students must complete work on their own. Generative AI is not to be used.\n\n\nClass reflections\nAfter each week, you will write a 1 paragraph reflection on the material that was presented in class. This can include your thoughts on how you will use these lessons in your own research and data visualizations, ways in which you have investigated this topic (or expect to) on your own, or what else you’d like to learn in this area. The purpose of this assignment is not to be burdensome, but to keep you engaged in the course material, and providing feedback to me on what parts you’ve found useful, what you’ve struggled with, and what you’d like to see more of in the future.\nThere will be 10 class reflections (you can select which classes you want to reflect upon).\nDue Date: Reflections are due 1 week after each class. For example, if class is on Tuesday September 1, the reflection for that class is due on Tuesday September 8 by 11:59pm.\nGrading: Reflections will be graded as follows:\n\nFull credit: Reflections thoughtfully engage with course content, demonstrate the student thought about material and how it would (or wouldn’t) be relevant to their work and development. This is the level of engagement I expect for this course.\nHalf credit: Reflections are superficial and demonstrate minimal engagement with the course content. A half credit grade indicates better engagement is required for the next reflection. I do not expect to assign these grades often.\n\nAcademic Integrity: Students may use class notes and class resource materials. Students are not permitted to collaborate on assignments. Students must complete work on their own.\n\n\nCapstone assignment\nDescription: At the end of the semester, you will complete a capstone assignment where you create a series of visualizations based on your research data, data coming from your lab, or other data that is publicly available. I expect this assignment to be completed in R Markdown, annotated, and knitted into an easy-to-read .html file. I also expect your code to be fully commented such that I can understand what you are doing with each step, and why. You will be required to submit a capstone assignment “plan” by the beginning of November.\nGrading: Guidance will be provided for the grading of the capstone assignment. Assignments completed outside R Markdown, or not knitted to a .html are not acceptable.\nAcademic Integrity: Students may use class notes and class resource materials. Students are not permitted to collaborate on assignments. Students must complete work on their own.\n\n\nDue dates\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nReflections\n1 week after each class\n\n\nRecitations\nSunday after each class\n\n\nModule 1: Good and bad visualizations\nMonday, September 1, 2025\n\n\nModule 2: Coding Fundamentals\nTuesday, October 7, 2025\n\n\nModule 3: Data Exploration\nTuesday, November 4, 2025\n\n\nModule 4: Putting it together\nTuesday, December 9, 2025\n\n\nCapstone plan\nTuesday, October 28, 2025\n\n\nCapstone\nFriday, December 12, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate assignments\nI expect you will turn assignments in on time.

    "title": "Syllabus, Autumn 2025",
    "section": "Other course policies",
    "text": "Other course policies\n\nDiscussion and communication guidelines\nI expect all communication will be respectful and thoughtful.\n\n\nAcademic Misconduct/Academic Integrity\nSee Descriptions of major course assignments, above, for my specific guidelines about collaboration and academic integrity in the context of this online class. Academic integrity is essential to maintaining an environment that fosters excellence in teaching, research, and other educational and scholarly activities. Thus, The Ohio State University and the Committee on Academic Misconduct (COAM) expect that all students have read and understand the University’s Code of Student Conduct, and that all students will complete all academic and scholarly assignments with fairness and honesty. Students must recognize that failure to follow the rules and guidelines established in the University’s Code of Student Conduct and this syllabus may constitute Academic Misconduct.\nThe Ohio State University’s Code of Student Conduct (Section 3335-23-04) defines academic misconduct as: Any activity that tends to compromise the academic integrity of the University or subvert the educational process. Examples of academic misconduct include (but are not limited to) plagiarism, collusion (unauthorized collaboration), copying the work of another student, and possession of unauthorized materials during an examination. Ignorance of the University’s Code of Student Conduct is never considered an excuse for academic misconduct, so I recommend that you review the Code of Student Conduct and, specifically, the sections dealing with academic misconduct.\nIf I suspect that a student has committed academic misconduct in this course, I am obligated by University Rules to report my suspicions to the Committee on Academic Misconduct. If COAM determines that you have violated the University’s Code of Student Conduct (i.e., committed academic misconduct), the sanctions for the misconduct could include a failing grade in this course and suspension or dismissal from the University.\nIf you have any questions about the above policy or what constitutes academic misconduct in this course, please contact me.\n\n\nUse of Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Co-Pilot or similar)\nArtificial intelligence tools, like ChatGPT, Microsoft Co-Pilot or similar are not to be used on assignments unless instructions explicitly indicate to do so. Suspected unauthorized use of generative AI on assignments of any type will be reported to COAM.\n\n\nCreating an environment free from harassment, discrimination, and sexual misconduct\nThe Ohio State University is committed to building and maintaining a community to reflect diversity and to improve opportunities for all. All Buckeyes have the right to be free from harassment, discrimination, and sexual misconduct. Ohio State does not discriminate on the basis of age, ancestry, color, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, genetic information, HIV/AIDS status, military status, national origin, pregnancy (childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or protected veteran status, or any other bases under the law, in its activities, academic programs, admission, and employment. Members of the university community also have the right to be free from all forms of sexual misconduct: sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and sexual exploitation.\nTo report harassment, discrimination, sexual misconduct, or retaliation and/or seek confidential and non-confidential resources and supportive measures, contact the Civil Rights Compliance Office:\nOnline reporting form at civilrights.osu.edu Call 614-247-5838 or TTY 614-688-8605, Or Email civilrights@osu.edu\nThe university is committed to stopping sexual misconduct, preventing its recurrence, eliminating any hostile environment, and remedying its discriminatory effects. All university employees have reporting responsibilities to the Civil Rights Compliance Office to ensure the university can take appropriate action:\n\nAll university employees, except those exempted by legal privilege of confidentiality or expressly identified as a confidential reporter, have an obligation to report incidents of sexual assault immediately.\nThe following employees have an obligation to report all other forms of sexual misconduct as soon as practicable but at most within five workdays of becoming aware of such information: 1. Any human resource professional (HRP); 2. Anyone who supervises faculty, staff, students, or volunteers; 3. Chair/director; and 4. Faculty member.\n\nIn addition, this course adheres to The Principles of Community adopted by the College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences. These principles can be found at https://cfaes.osu.edu/about/cfaes-principles-community. If you have been a victim of or a witness to harassment or discrimination or a bias incident, you can report it online and anonymously (if you choose) at https://civilrights.osu.edu/.\n\n\nIntellectual Diversity\nOhio State is committed to fostering a culture of open inquiry and intellectual diversity within the classroom. This course will cover a range of information and may include discussions or debates about controversial issues, beliefs, or policies. Any such discussions and debates are intended to support understanding of the approved curriculum and relevant course objectives rather than promote any specific point of view. Students will be assessed on principles applicable to the field of study and the content covered in the course. Preparing students for citizenship includes helping them develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to reach their own conclusions regarding complex or controversial matters.\n\n\nReligious accommodations\nOhio State has had a longstanding practice of making reasonable academic accommodations for students’ religious beliefs and practices in accordance with applicable law. In 2023, Ohio State updated its practice to align with new state legislation. Under this new provision, students must be in early communication with their instructors regarding any known accommodation requests for religious beliefs and practices, providing notice of specific dates for which they request alternative accommodations within 14 days after the first instructional day of the course. Instructors in turn shall not question the sincerity of a student’s religious or spiritual belief system in reviewing such requests and shall keep requests for accommodations confidential.\nWith sufficient notice, instructors will provide students with reasonable alternative accommodations with regard to examinations and other academic requirements with respect to students’ sincerely held religious beliefs and practices by allowing up to three absences each semester for the student to attend or participate in religious activities. Examples of religious accommodations can include, but are not limited to, rescheduling an exam, altering the time of a student’s presentation, allowing make-up assignments to substitute for missed class work, or flexibility in due dates or research responsibilities. If concerns arise about a requested accommodation, instructors are to consult their tenure initiating unit head for assistance.\nA student’s request for time off shall be provided if the student’s sincerely held religious belief or practice severely affects the student’s ability to take an exam or meet an academic requirement and the student has notified their instructor, in writing during the first 14 days after the course begins, of the date of each absence. Although students are required to provide notice within the first 14 days after a course begins, instructors are strongly encouraged to work with the student to provide a reasonable accommodation if a request is made outside the notice period. A student may not be penalized for an absence approved under this policy.\nIf students have questions or disputes related to academic accommodations, they should contact their course instructor, and then their department or college office. For questions or to report discrimination or harassment based on religion, individuals should contact the Civil Rights Compliance Office.\n\n\nWeather or other short-term closing\nAlthough Ohio State strives to remain open to ensure continuity of services to students and the public, extreme conditions can warrant the usage of the university’s Weather or Other Short-Term Closing Policy. Please visit this webpage to learn more about preparing for potential closings and planning ahead for winter weather.\n\n\nCounseling and Consultation Services/Mental Health\nAs a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the aforementioned conditions, you can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via the Office of Student Life Counseling and Consultation Services (CCS) by visiting ccs.osu.edu or calling (614) 292- 5766. CCS is located on the 4th Floor of the Younkin Success Center and 10th Floor of Lincoln Tower. You can reach an on-call counselor when CCS is closed at (614) 292-5766 and 24 hour emergency help is also available through the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-(800)-273-TALK or at suicidepreventionlifeline.org\nDavid Wirt, wirt.9@osu.edu, is the CFAES embedded mental health counselor in Columbus. He is available for new consultations and to establish routine care. To schedule with David, please call 614-292-5766. Students should mention their affiliation with CFAES when setting up a phone screening.\nDr. Schaad, schaad.15@osu.edu, is the CFAES embedded mental health counselor in Wooster. She is available for new consultations and to establish routine care. To schedule with\nDr. Schaad, please call 614-292-5766. Students should mention their affiliation with CFAES when setting up a phone screening.\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility accomodations\nThe university strives to maintain a healthy and accessible environment to support student learning in and out of the classroom. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic, or temporary medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations, I may request that you register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion.\nIf you are ill and need to miss class, including if you are staying home and away from others while experiencing symptoms of a viral infection or fever, please let me know immediately. In cases where illness interacts with an underlying medical condition, please consult with Student Life Disability Services to request reasonable accommodations. You can connect with them at slds@osu.edu; 614-292-3307; or slds.osu.edu.",

But, because we have 8 groups this gets a little bit complicated. For example, the first row says that the groups 0-9 and 10-19 are not significantly different. The second row says that 0-9 is significantly different from 20-29. We could sort out all the differences by looking at all the comparisons and making sure that groups that are different do not share a letter.\nUse rcompanion::cldList() to create the groups for us. Reading the documentation about cldList() helped me learn that:\n\nthere needs to be a formula that compares the p-values (here, p.adj) to a comparison column (here, one I created called comparison)\nthere needs to be a comparison column that is in the form similar to “Treat.A - Treat.B = 0” where =, 0 are removed by default. The removal of 0 affects our group names but we can fix that later. Since we have hyphens in our group names, I removed them since this column only allows one hyphen between the groups to be compared\nset a threshold for what p-value is considered significant\n\nTo do this, first:\n\nI removed the hyphen from group1 and group2 in new variables called group1_rep and group2_rep\nThen, I made a new column called comparison that “glues” together (i.e., pastes) the values from group1_rep and group2_rep\n\n\n# combine group1 and group2 to make one column called comparison\n# then replace hyphens with something else because cldList can only have one hyphen\nkruskal_chol_posthoc_1 &lt;- kruskal_chol_posthoc |&gt;\n  mutate(group1_rep = str_replace_all(group1, pattern = \"-\", replacement = \"to\"),\n         group2_rep = str_replace_all(group2, pattern = \"-\", replacement = \"to\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(comparison = glue(\"{group1_rep} -{group2_rep}\"))\n\nknitr::kable(head(kruskal_chol_posthoc_1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.y.\ngroup1\ngroup2\nn1\nn2\nstatistic\np\np.adj\np.adj.signif\ngroup1_rep\ngroup2_rep\ncomparison\n\n\n\n\nTotChol\n0-9\n10-19\n415\n1214\n0.0499933\n0.9601277\n0.9601277\nns\n0to9\n10to19\n0to9 - 10to19\n\n\nTotChol\n0-9\n20-29\n415\n1257\n10.5808362\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n****\n0to9\n20to29\n0to9 - 20to29\n\n\nTotChol\n0-9\n30-39\n415\n1273\n15.8700258\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n****\n0to9\n30to39\n0to9 - 30to39\n\n\nTotChol\n0-9\n40-49\n415\n1354\n21.2610617\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n****\n0to9\n40to49\n0to9 - 40to49\n\n\nTotChol\n0-9\n50-59\n415\n1234\n22.1590557\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n****\n0to9\n50to59\n0to9 - 50to59\n\n\nTotChol\n0-9\n60-69\n415\n873\n18.7771929\n0.0000000\n0.0000000\n****\n0to9\n60to69\n0to9 - 60to69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# run cldList()\n(group_cldList &lt;- cldList(p.adj ~ comparison,\n        data = kruskal_chol_posthoc_1,\n        threshold = 0.05))\n\n  Group Letter MonoLetter\n1   to9      a      a    \n2 1to19      a      a    \n3 2to29      b       b   \n4 3to39      c        c  \n5 4to49     de         de\n6 5to59      d         d \n7 6to69      e          e\n8    7+      c        c  \n\n\nThe zeroes of the Group column got lost, let’s fix that by replacing with the values we are actually going to want to use (those with the hyphen vs. those that have “to”).\n\n# grab a vector that contains the names of the AgeDecade\n# want this without any missimg values\nage_groups &lt;- levels(NHANES$AgeDecade)\n\n# replace the groups with missing 0 with our cleaned up groups\ngroup_cldList$Group &lt;- age_groups\n\n# did it work?\ngroup_cldList\n\n   Group Letter MonoLetter\n1    0-9      a      a    \n2  10-19      a      a    \n3  20-29      b       b   \n4  30-39      c        c  \n5  40-49     de         de\n6  50-59      d         d \n7  60-69      e          e\n8    70+      c        c  \n\n\nOr, you could create groups from kruskal_chol_posthoc results manually.\n\nunique(NHANES$AgeDecade)\n\n[1]  30-39  0-9    40-49  60-69  50-59  10-19  20-29  70+   &lt;NA&gt;  \nLevels:  0-9  10-19  20-29  30-39  40-49  50-59  60-69  70+\n\n(group_manual &lt;- \n    data.frame(group = levels(NHANES$AgeDecade), # use levels to get the right order\n               letter = c(\"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"de\", \"d\", \"e\", \"c\"))) # letters manually\n\n   group letter\n1    0-9      a\n2  10-19      a\n3  20-29      b\n4  30-39      c\n5  40-49     de\n6  50-59      d\n7  60-69      e\n8    70+      c\n\n\nMake a dataframe that has the maximum total cholesterol for each age so that we know where to place the numbers on the plot.

I will go over a few different ways to do this.\nThe purpose of today’s session is more to give you practical experience with running and retrieving statistical analysis output, than teaching about the assumptions and background of the test itself. If you are looking for a good statistics class, I would recommend Dr. Kristin Mercer’s HCS 8887 Experimental Design.\n\nLoad libraries and data\nBefore we get started, let’s load our libraries.\nWe are going to use data that was collection about body characteristics of penguins on Palmer Station in Antarctica.

    "text": "2 group comparisons (t-tests or similar)\n\nOur question: Is there a significant difference in the body_weight_g of male and female penguins?\n\nBefore we run the statistics, let’s make a plot to see what this data looks like.\n\n# what are the values for sex?\nunique(penguins$sex)\n\n[1] male   female &lt;NA&gt;  \nLevels: female male\n\n# plot\n(penguins_by_sex &lt;- penguins |&gt;\n  drop_na(body_mass_g, sex) |&gt; # remove NAs for body_mass_g and sex\n  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = body_mass_g, color = sex)) + \n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + # remove outliers\n  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.3) + # jitter only in the x direction\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\")) + # change x-axis labels\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Sex\",\n       y = \"Body Mass (g)\",\n       title = \"Body mass of penguins by sex\",\n       subtitle = \"Collected from Palmer Station, Antarctica\",\n       caption = \"Data accessed from the R package palmerpenguins\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like there is a difference here. Before adding the statistics to our plot, let’s:\n\ntest that our data is suitable for running the text we want\nrun the statistical test separately from the plot\n\n\nTesting assumptions\nBriefly, in order to use parametric procedures (like a t-test), we need to be sure our data meets the assumptions for 1) normality and 2) constant variance. This is just one way to do these tests, there are others that I am not going to go over.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration by Allison Horst\n\n\n\n\n\nNormality\nWe will test normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test using the function rstatix::shapiro_test(). This function is a pipe-friendly wrapper for the function shapiro.test(), which just means you can use it with pipes.\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  drop_na(body_mass_g, sex) |&gt; # remove NAs\n  group_by(sex) |&gt; # test by sex\n  shapiro_test(body_mass_g) # test for normality\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  sex    variable    statistic            p\n  &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 female body_mass_g     0.919 0.0000000616\n2 male   body_mass_g     0.925 0.000000123 \n\n\nThis data is not normal, which means we need to use non-parametric tests. Since we are not meeting the assumption for nornality, really you don’t need to test for constant variance, but I’ll show you how to do it anyway.\n\n\nConstant variance\nWe can test for equal variance using Levene’s test, levene_test() which is part of the rstatix package. Again, this is a pipe-friendly wrapper for the function levene.test().\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  drop_na(body_mass_g, sex) |&gt; # remove NAs\n  levene_test(body_mass_g ~ sex) # test for constant variance\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n    df1   df2 statistic      p\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1   331      6.06 0.0143\n\n\nNo constant variance. Double Non-parametric.\nCan we visualize normality another way?\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  drop_na(body_mass_g, sex) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = sex, fill = sex)) +\n  ggridges::geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.7) + # density ridgeline plot\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\")) +\n  theme_classic() +  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Body Mass (g)\",\n       y = \"Sex\",\n       title = \"Distribution of body weights for male and female penguins\")\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 235\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two distributions look bimodal(and thus not normal). This is likely because we have 3 different species of penguins here. You can see below that actually each species looks reasonably normal.\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  drop_na(body_mass_g, sex) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = sex)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(species), rows = vars(sex)) + # 2 way facet\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Body Mass (g)\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-parametric t-test\nThis means if we want to test for different means, we can use the Wilcoxon rank sun test, or Mann Whitney test. If your data was normal, you could just change wilcox_test() to t_test() and the rest would be the same.\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  drop_na(body_mass_g, sex) |&gt;\n  wilcox_test(body_mass_g ~ sex,\n              paired = FALSE)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  .y.         group1 group2    n1    n2 statistic        p\n* &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 body_mass_g female male     165   168     6874. 1.81e-15\n\n\nThis is not surprising, that there is a significant difference in body weight between male and female penguins. We can see this clearly in our plot.\nHow can we add the stats to our plot?\n\n\nPlot\n\nUsing stat_compare_means()\nThe function stat_compare_means() allows mean comparison p-values to be easily added to a ggplot.\nNote, the function should look at your data and test for normality and pick the statistical test accordingly. You can see that is working in the chunk below, but I would recommend that you always do your own statistical test and make sure you plot accordingly.\n\npenguins_by_sex +\n  stat_compare_means()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npenguins_by_sex +\n  stat_compare_means(method = \"wilcox.test\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManually with geom_text() or annotate()\nIn general, plotting using geom_text() is easier, and follows classic geom_() syntax (e.g., includes aes()) but for some reason these don’t pass as vectorized objects so sometimes it yields low quality images. Using annotate() passes as vectors and thus tends to be higher quality. You can decide which you want to use depending on your purpose.\nIf I’m being honest, the most common way that I would add statistics to a plot if I was trying to do just a few simple plots at once, would be with annotate() . I like to use annotate() over geom_text() or geom_label() because it is vectorized and don’t become low quality down the road.\nWith geom_text()\n\npenguins_by_sex +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 2, y = 6500, label = \"*\"), # x, y, and label within aes()\n            color = \"black\", size = 6)\n\nWarning in geom_text(aes(x = 2, y = 6500, label = \"*\"), color = \"black\", : All aesthetics have length 1, but the data has 333 rows.\nℹ Please consider using `annotate()` or provide this layer with data containing\n  a single row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith annotate()\n\npenguins_by_sex +\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", # note no aes()\n           x = 2, y = 6500, \n           label = \"*\", \n           size = 6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also add multiple annotation layers. I’m introducing a new function here, glue() which is amazing for easy syntax pasting of strings with data.\nThe syntax for glue() is like this:\n\nx &lt;- 2 + 3\n\nglue(\"2 + 3 = {x}\")\n\n2 + 3 = 5\n\n\n\n# we did this already, just assigning to object\nby_sex_pval &lt;- penguins |&gt;\n  drop_na(body_mass_g, sex) |&gt;\n  wilcox_test(body_mass_g ~ sex,\n              paired = FALSE)\n\n# plot\npenguins_by_sex +\n  ylim(2500, 7500) + # adjust the y-axis so there's space for the label\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 2, y = 6500, label = \"*\", size = 6) +\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 2, y = 7000,\n           label = glue(\"Wilcoxon signed rank test \\np-value = {by_sex_pval$p}\"))",

Along with normally distributed data, this means that we can use parametric tests. In the case of &gt;2 samples, that would be ANOVA.\n\n\n\nANOVA\nThe most commonly used function to run ANOVA in R is called aov() which is a part of the stats package that is pre-loaded with base R. So no new packages need to be installed here.\nIf we want to learn more about the function aov() we can do so using the code below. The help documentation will show up in the bottom right quadrant of your RStudio.\n\n?aov()\n\nWe can run an ANOVA by indicating our model, and here I’m also selecting to drop the NAs for our variables of interest, and filtering within the data = argument.\n\naov_female_massbyspecies &lt;- \n  aov(data = penguins |&gt; \n             filter(sex == \"female\") |&gt;\n             drop_na(body_mass_g, species),\n      body_mass_g ~ species)\n\nNow lets look at the aov object.\n\nsummary(aov_female_massbyspecies)\n\n             Df   Sum Sq  Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \nspecies       2 60350016 30175008   393.2 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals   162 12430757    76733                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nWe can take the output of our ANOVA and use the function tidy() within the broom package to turn our output into a tidy table. Here, the notation broom::tidy() means I want to use the function tidy() that is a part of the broom package. This works even though I haven’t called library(broom) at the beginning of my script.\n\ntidy_anova &lt;- broom::tidy(aov_female_massbyspecies)\n\nknitr::kable(tidy_anova)\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf\nsumsq\nmeansq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nspecies\n2\n60350016\n30175008.01\n393.2465\n0\n\n\nResiduals\n162\n12430757\n76733.07\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how this is different from just saving the ANOVA summary?

We will do our post-hoc analysis using Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference test and the function HSD.test() which is a part of the useful package agricolae.\n\ntukey_massbyspecies &lt;- HSD.test(aov_female_massbyspecies, \n                      trt = \"species\", \n                      console = TRUE) # prints the results to console\n\n\nStudy: aov_female_massbyspecies ~ \"species\"\n\nHSD Test for body_mass_g \n\nMean Square Error:  76733.07 \n\nspecies,  means\n\n          body_mass_g      std  r       se  Min  Max    Q25  Q50     Q75\nAdelie       3368.836 269.3801 73 32.42126 2850 3900 3175.0 3400 3550.00\nChinstrap    3527.206 285.3339 34 47.50637 2700 4150 3362.5 3550 3693.75\nGentoo       4679.741 281.5783 58 36.37285 3950 5200 4462.5 4700 4875.00\n\nAlpha: 0.05 ; DF Error: 162 \nCritical Value of Studentized Range: 3.345258 \n\nGroups according to probability of means differences and alpha level( 0.05 )\n\nTreatments with the same letter are not significantly different.\n\n          body_mass_g groups\nGentoo       4679.741      a\nChinstrap    3527.206      b\nAdelie       3368.836      c\n\n\nLike we did with the aov object, you can also look at the resulting HSD.test object (here, tukey_massbyspecies) in your environment pane.\nHere, instead of using the broom package, you can convert the part of the tukey_bill_length object that contains the post-hoc groupings into a dataframe using as.data.frame().\n\ntidy_tukey &lt;- as.data.frame(tukey_massbyspecies$groups)\n\ntidy_tukey\n\n          body_mass_g groups\nGentoo       4679.741      a\nChinstrap    3527.206      b\nAdelie       3368.836      c\n\n\n\n\nPlot\n\nUsing stat_compare_means()\n\npenguins_f_massbyspecies +\n  stat_compare_means()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npenguins_f_massbyspecies +\n  stat_compare_means(method = \"anova\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManually with geom_text() or annotate()\nIn general, plotting using geom_text() is easier, and follows classic geom_() syntax (e.g., includes aes()) but for some reason these don’t pass as vectorized objects so sometimes it yields low quality images.

You can decide which you want to use depending on your purpose.\nWe want to add the letters to this plot, so we can tell which groups of penguin species are significantly different.\nBefore we can do this, we will need to do some of everyone’s favorite task, wrangling. We are going to figure out what the maximum body_mass_g for each species is, so it will help us determine where to put our letter labels. Then, we can add our labels to be higher than the largest data point. We will calculate this for each group, so that the letters are always right about our boxplot.\n\nbody_mass_max &lt;- penguins |&gt;\n  filter(sex == \"female\") |&gt;\n  drop_na(body_mass_g, species) |&gt;\n  group_by(species) |&gt;\n  summarize(max_body_mass = max(body_mass_g))\n\nbody_mass_max\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  species   max_body_mass\n  &lt;fct&gt;             &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie             3900\n2 Chinstrap          4150\n3 Gentoo             5200\n\n\nLet’s add our post-hoc group info to body_mass_max, since those two dataframes are not in the same order. Instead of binding the two dataframes together, we are going to join them using one of the dplyr _join() functions, which allows you to combine dataframes based on a specific common column. The join functions work like this:\n\ninner_join(): includes all rows in x and y.\nleft_join(): includes all rows in x.\nright_join(): includes all rows in y.\nfull_join(): includes all rows in x or y.\n\nIn this case, it doesn’t matter which _join() we use because our dfs all have the exact same rows.\n\ntidier_tukey &lt;- tidy_tukey |&gt;\n  rownames_to_column() |&gt; # converts rownames to columns\n  rename(species = rowname) # renames the column now called rowname to species\n  \n# join\nbody_mass_for_plotting &lt;- full_join(tidier_tukey, body_mass_max,\n                               by = \"species\")\n\nLet’s plot.

If you don’t use the mutate() function to convert your year to numeric (it is a character column after pivoting) this will still work, but calling min() and max() on non-numeric data doesn’t make too much sense so I think its generally risky and could introduce problems in other situations (but doesn’t in this one).\nFor happiness:\n\nhappiness_long &lt;- happiness |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = !country, # all columns but country\n               names_to = \"year\", # colnames to new col called \"year\"\n               values_to = \"happy_value\") |&gt; # values from cells to \"happy_value\" \n  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) # convert year col to be numeric (is character)\n\nhappiness_long |&gt; \n  summarize(min_year = min(year),\n            max_year = max(year))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  min_year max_year\n     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     2005     2022\n\n\nFor life expectancy:\n\nlife_expectancy_long &lt;- life_expectancy |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = !country, # all columns but country\n               names_to = \"year\", # colnames to new col called \"year\"\n               values_to = \"life_exp\") |&gt;   # values from cells to \"happy_value\" \n  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) # convert year col to be numeric (is character)\n  \nlife_expectancy_long |&gt; \n  summarize(min_year = min(year),\n            max_year = max(year))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  min_year max_year\n     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1800     2100",

Some breeds can be aloof with everyone but their owner, while other breeds treat everyone they know like their best friend.\n\n\nGood With Young Children\nNot Recommended\nGood With Children\nA breed’s level of tolerance and patience with childrens’ behavior, and overall family-friendly nature. Dogs should always be supervised around young children, or children of any age who have little exposure to dogs.\n\n\nGood With Other Dogs\nNot Recommended\nGood With Other Dogs\nHow generally friendly a breed is towards other dogs. Dogs should always be supervised for interactions and introductions with other dogs, but some breeds are innately more likely to get along with other dogs, both at home and in public.\n\n\nShedding Level\nNo Shedding\nHair Everywhere\nHow much fur and hair you can expect the breed to leave behind. Breeds with high shedding will need to be brushed more frequently, are more likely to trigger certain types of allergies, and are more likely to require more consistent vacuuming and lint-rolling.\n\n\nCoat Grooming Frequency\nMonthly\nDaily\nHow frequently a breed requires bathing, brushing, trimming, or other kinds of coat maintenance.

If you click it, R will run all of the code in your R Markdown file, and default compile it to a .html file (though you can select to compile to other file formats).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare what our document looks like when viewing it in RStudio (left), and after it is knitted (right).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a little bit of R experience, you can begin to see how (some of) the content on the left related to the knitted document on the right. We see text, code chunks (but not all of them), and the output of code.\nNow that we have seen a template R Markdown and have 10,000 foot view as to what it is, we can start going through what the different pieces of the document are.",

If you want this to be today’s date (whatever that is) you can use “Sys.Date()”\noutput: will indicate the format of your compiled document. I would recommend for this class you use html_document as it is the richest format. Your output will be a .html file, which you can save or share.\n\nHere’s a simple example.\n\n---\ntitle: \"This is my descriptive title\"\nauthor: \"Jess\"\ndate: \"May 10, 2022\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n\nIn the YAML, you can also set options that govern how your document will be compiled within output. For example, you can add a table of contents, make that toc float, add a theme, number your sections, and add a button that allows someone to click and access your .Rmd from your knitted .html file. This last one is especially nice because it allows you to send one viewable document, and if someone wants to edit it, they can download and do so easily. This is how I will ask you to submit your class assignments.\nHere’s an example of what a more customized YAML could look like.\n\n---\ntitle: \"This is my descriptive title\"\nauthor: \"Jess\"\ndate: \"August 9, 2024\"\noutput: \n  html_document: # knit to a .html doc\n    toc: true # creates a table of contents\n    toc_float: true # has that TOC float so you can see it even when you scroll\n    number_sections: true # number your sections\n    theme: flatly # set a global theme\n    code_download: true # insert the code download button\n---\n\nBe sure you pay attention to the indents (which are 2 or 4 spaces, and not tabs), as the YAML is picky here. If your indents are not correct, you will get an error when you knit. Also, if you are missing a colon, your document will knit weirdly or not at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro tip to avoid a tab/space debacle\n\n\n\nYou can set in RStudio to insert spaces when you click tab by going to Preferences &gt; Code &gt; Use spaces for tab (and indicate 2).\n\n\nAbove are just some of the options that I like to put in my YAML, but there are tons more. Additional output options that are explained on the second page of the RStudio R Markdown cheatsheet.",

    "text": "Text\nUnlike an R script (.R), where R by default interprets anything as code (and material that isn’t code needed to be commented out by using #), in an R Markdown, the default is text (and code exists only within code chunks or backticks).\nThe text portion of the document is written in a language called Markdown (which is why this format is called R Markdown). The philosophy of Markdown is that it is easy to both write and read. If you want to learn more about markup languages I’d recommend the this brief explanation by Michael Broe from a past Code Club Session and the Markup language wikipedia page.\nIf we look back to our template R Markdown, we can see there is text written in the same way that we would write in Word document, or an email, and we recognize immediately as text (i.e., the sentence at line 24).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we can also see markup that is perhaps not immediately, recognizable, for example, the **Knit** on line 16. In this case, two asterisks around a word will make it compile to be bolded (second paragraph in the right photo).\nBelow I’m compiling some commonly used markdown syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from R Markdown Reference Guide\n\n\n\n\nNote, the headers are useful and will indicate the levels in your table of contents. You want to use them, and make them meaningful for your document.\nYou can use Markdown to insert tables, images, mathematical formulas, block quotes, and almost anything else you’d like. You can even write your papers and dissertation in R Markdown. The old version of this course website is made with distill and R Markdown. My lab website is made with R Markdown and the hugo Aperó theme. Quarto and .qmd documents are a slightly updated version of RMarkdown with some new functionality (here you can find some discussion about the different between the two). Here are some links where you can find lots of other Markdown syntactical information:\n\nMarkdown Guide\nR Markdown reference guide\nR Studio R Markdown Cheatsheet\njust google for what you want\n\nSo how is this useful for this course and making your own data analyses more reproducible? You can embed text along with your code, where you provide introductory information, your rationale for data analysis decision making, links and more information about interpreting your code and its output, provide context as to your results, and anything else that would aid your data’s interpretation.\nAnd, when you want to make a small change, you can do so, knit, and everything else automatically updates.",

    "text": "Code\nCode chunks are the parts of your R Markdown document where code lives. You can insert a new code chunk by:\n\nusing the keyboard shortcut Cmd + Option + I (Mac) or Ctrl + Alt + I (Windows)\ntyping ```{r} and ``` (and your code goes in between)\nusing the Add Chunk command in the editor toolbar and select R\n\nCode chunks look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code goes in the empty line, and there can be more than 1 bit of code per chunk though I would say if you start having to scroll in your chunk its probably too long.\n\nthe gear allows you to modify the chunk options (we are going to talk more about this)\nthe triangle with the line below it runs all code chunks that come previous to this chunk\nthe play button runs the current chunk\n\nYou can still add comments within a code chunk, but you need to comment them out using #.\n# here is my in chunk annotation\nsome_function()\nWhen you knit your R Markdown, this process will run all of the code in your document. This means if you have code that throws errors or doesn’t work, your document will not knit. This is some of why I am asking you to knit for your final assignments - all your code needs to work!\nYou can also embed code inline (i.e., within your text).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw\nRendered\n\n\n\n\nThere are `r 365*24` hours in a year\nThere are 8760 hours in a year\n\n\nThere are `r nrow(cars)` observations (i.e. rows) in the cars dataset\nThere are 50 observations (i.e. rows) in the cars dataset\n\n\n\nThink about how you could use this – embed information from your data analysis (e.g, p-values) within your narrative text without having to hard-code/type it in manually.\n\nAdding options to your code chunks\nYou add options to your code chunks between the {}. This gives R additional instructions regarding running your code and compiling your document. Here are some common examples:\n\necho = FALSE runs your code chunk, displays output, but does not display code in your final doc (this is useful if you want to show a figure but not the code used to create it)\neval = FALSE does not run your code, but does display it in your final doc\ninclude = FALSE runs your code but does not display the code or its output in your final doc\nmessage = FALSE prevents messages from showing up in your final doc\nwarning = FALSE prevents earnings from showing up in your final doc\nfig.height = X and fig.width = Y will allow you to specify the dimensions of your figures (in inches)\nfig.align = can be set to “left”, “right”, or “center”\nfig.cap = \"Your figure caption\" will allow you to set a figure caption\nfig.alt = \"Your alt text\" will allow you to set alt text for screen readers\ncache = TRUE will cache results, meaning if you have a chunk that takes a long time to run, if you haven’t changed anything and you knit again, the code won’t run again but access the cache.",

I will mark these at 0 or 1 points, with 1 point given for completion of at least 70% of the assignment.\nCapstone assignment: At the end of the semester, you will complete a capstone assignment where you create a series of visualizations based on your research data, data coming from your lab, or other data that is publicly available.
