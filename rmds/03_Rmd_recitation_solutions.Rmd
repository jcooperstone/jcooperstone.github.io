## R Markdown Recitation

This will be your template RMarkdown document for playing around with RMarkdown. This was opened using the default Rmd settings. You are going to be playing around with the 3 components of an Rmd:

1. text
2. code
3. the YAML (aka the header)

To see if each of your changes has worked, you will need to knit.

# Text

Write text that generates in italics.
*This text is in italics*

Write text that generates in bold
**This text is in bold**

Try playing around with header levels

# Biggest header

## Second biggest header

### Third biggest header

### Four biggest header
You get the idea.

Add a hyperlink to [our class website](https://datavisualizing.netlify.app/)

Add an image. Note you will do this differently if you are adding an image from internet vs one you have on your local machine. Also remember your working directory is the location of your Rmd and you may want to have a directory called `img` where images are stored.

Add a block quote

> Here is an important block quote

Make a bulleted list

* Thing 1
* Thing 2
* Thing 3

# Code

Create a code chunk by typing
```{r}

```

Create a code chunk using the toolbar
```{r}

```

Create a code chunk using the keyboard shortcut
```{r}

```

Write some code within a chunk and execute it
```{r}
getwd()
```

Write some code in line (within your text) and knit

Is it `r weekdays(as.POSIXlt("2022-09-09"))` yet?

Try using the different options for your code chunks. Remember you can use multiple at once.

Get code to run but not display
```{r include = FALSE}
my_vector <- c(1:10)
```

(See it did actually run as it shows up here.)
```{r}
my_vector
```

Get code to display but not run
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Get code to hide messages
```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
```

Note, this still displays "warnings" which are different from messages. You can hide warnings too but do so with care.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Add a figure caption
```{r cars, fig.cap = "Here is my plot about cars"}
plot(cars)
```

Add alt text
```{r cars2, fig.alt= "A scatterplot showing the relationship between speed and distance of cars. The two are strongly positively correlated, meaning cars moving at a faster speed go a further distance (I think)."}
plot(cars)
```


Give your chunk a name
```{r how-many-cars}
dim(cars)
```


# The YAML
Edit the default components of the YAML to be personalized to you

Play around with adding a:
Table of contents
Code download button
Code folding

Play around with the default themes https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/ 

Play around themes from `prettydoc`, `rmdformats` and/or `tufte` 

# Other stuff
Play around with the visual editor

Make the table of contents viewable in your document
