This course aims to introduce students to the principles and practice of data visualization. Students will learn fundamental principles of data visualization and create figures that appropriately and ethically represent their data. Data visualizations will be created in the R programming environment, using tools including the grammar of graphics implemented in `ggplot2`. In the process of creating visualizations, students will also become familiar with data handling and wrangling in R.
