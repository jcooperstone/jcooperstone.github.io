```

## Introduction
We are going to practice making Manhattan plots today.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # for everything
library(ggrepel) # for repelling labels
library(qqman) # for gwas data

gwasResults <- qqman::gwasResults
```

## Investigate your data.

### What are your columns?

### How many markers are there?

### How are the markers distributed across the chromosomes?

## Make a Manhattan plot.
Color by chromosome, make sure the x-axis breaks are appropriate, be sure your y-axis is -log10 pvalue. Label the top 3 most significant points with their SNP number.
