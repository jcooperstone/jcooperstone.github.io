# Intoduction

Today we are going to work with microbiome data. In this recitation we
are going to provide microbiome data as the result of the shotgun sequencing
of the pig gut microbiome.

-   Pig microbiome study: [paper](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.02506-22),
    [data](https://buckeyemailosu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/cooperstone_1_osu_edu/EY4vRHdMuKpOiuy-itag7ocB63AB3ukhjc0Y5jGRovfkvg?e=RnMz8e).

# Pig gut microbiome data

The goal of this recitation is to replicate the following plot, which
expresses the relationship between the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes
while the rest of the Phyla levels were assigned to *others*.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.alt='Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes abundance in pigs'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/updated_stacked_barplot.jpeg")
```

## How many rows and columns do the data have?

## How many phyla do the data contains and how many columns represents metadata of the experiment?

### Create a new column with a new phyla assignation

Keep the phyla when they are Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes,
otherwise assign Phyla to "Other phyla".

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Need a hint? (Click to expand)

Hint: You may need to pivot the data to evaluate the column names as observations

:::

### Compute the cumulative abundance by the new Phyla levels that you created

### Create the bar plot in ggplot

### Create the plot interactive

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ggplotly(your_awesome_plot)
```
