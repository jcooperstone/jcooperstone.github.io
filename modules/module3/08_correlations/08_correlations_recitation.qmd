## Introduction

We will be using some data collection from the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) which collects data to assess the health and nutritional status of people in the United States. The data from 2009-2012 has been compiled in an R package called `NHANES`.

```{r load libraries and data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# install.packages("NHANES")
library(NHANES)

# functionality and correlation packages
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(GGally)
library(Hmisc)
library(reshape2)
library(scales)

knitr::kable(head(NHANES))
```

## 1. How correlated are different measures of blood pressure?

In the NHANES dataset, there are 3 measurements for each systolic (the first/top number) and diastolic blood (the second/bottom number) pressure, and an average for each. How reproducible is each type of blood pressure measurement over the 3 samplings? Make visualizations to convey your findings.

## 2. How correlated are different physical measurements, health, and lifestyle variables?

In the NHANES dataset, there are data for subject `BMI`, `Pulse`, `BPSysAve`, `BPDiaAve`, `TotalChol`.

Create a series of plots/plot to show the relationship between these variables with each other.
