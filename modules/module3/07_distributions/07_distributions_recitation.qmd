## Introduction
Today you will be investigating some [data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/readme.md) from the Coffee Quality Database on coffee evaluation by the Coffee Quality Institute. You will look at the distribution of coffee evaluation scores across different characteristics, and include various metadata.
