## Reflections 
I ask you submit 8 of 11 recitations to Carmen to show you have made a good faith effort to engage with the course material. I will mark these at 0 or 1 points, with 1 point given for completion of at least 70% of the assignment.

**Due Date:** Recitations are due the Sunday after each class. For example, if class is on Tuesday September 9, the recitation for that class is due on Sunday September 14 by 11:59pm.

### Late assignments

I expect you will turn assignments in on time. Late assignments are not accepted. If there are extenuating circumstances that prevent you from turning in an assignment on time, please connect with me as soon as possible after such a situation arises for discussion about a possible deadline extension.
